    - (1% completed, work in progress)

  - models for endpoints
    - **needs work**
- options.py
  - enum classes for pydantic models
- strategies.py
  - sample strategies (RSI, MACD, BolingerBands)

    - ML strats are not ideal (**need** to think how transformation stage can be made to support them naturally)
  - Users may add their own strat here
- subscribers.py
  - consumers from redis streams
    - strategy workers
    - dashboard workers
      - **needs work**
    - database/flatfile workers
